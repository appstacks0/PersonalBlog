		<h2>About Moon's Kitchen</h2>

		<img src="images/about.jpg" alt="Cookbook with spices and herbs" style="width:50%;">

		<p>I’m Moon, the blogger behind all of the recipes, photographs and words splattered around Moon's Kitchen. I am beyond excited that you found us, and on top of that want to learn a little bit of me and what we do here.</p>

		<p>I love to eat. And I love to eat EVERYTHING, so here you’ll find a hodgepodge of recipes I love to make, and of course, love to eat. Just like anyone else, I indulge some days, and eat healthy other days. Some days I feel like making easy meals that require only a few ingredients, other days, I want to cook all day long, and use less common in ingredients like saffron and curry paste. Some days I feel like savory, and some days I feel like sweet. You get the point, there’s no niche here, I just aim at sharing delicious recipes that inspire you to get in the kitchen.</p>

		<p>If you’re looking for a specific level of skill, we have conveniently labeled and categorized all recipes, easy, medium, and hard, so you can take your pick.</p>
